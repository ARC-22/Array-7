## Problem 1: Minimum word distance ii (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii/)
Implement a class that receives a list of words, and implements a method that takes two words and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. 

Example:

Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”

Output: 3

Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"

Output: 1

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

## Problem 2: Minimum word distance iii (https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-iii/)

Provided a list of words and two words, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

Example:

Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].

Input: word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”

Output: 1

Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes"

Output: 3

Note:
You may assume word1 and word2 are both in the list.
